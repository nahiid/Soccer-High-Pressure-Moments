# High-Moments Soccer Analysis

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of soccer matches using advanced data processing and visualization techniques. The analysis is built on Python and utilizes several libraries to process and interpret soccer match data.

## Key Features
- Data loading and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy.
- Advanced data visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- Integration of machine learning algorithms for pattern recognition in match data.
- Custom functions for processing soccer-specific data metrics.

## Installation
To run the notebook, several libraries need to be installed
You can install all used packages using `pip`:
```bash
pip install requierments.txt
```

## Data
The analysis is based on sample match data from the Metrica Sports dataset. Data includes events and tracking information for both home and away teams.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `high_pre_soccer.ipynb`.
